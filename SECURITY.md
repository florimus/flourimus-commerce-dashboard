## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do the following:

1. **Do not open an issue describing the vulnerability on the public repository.** This avoids making the vulnerability known to the public before it can be addressed.

2. **Send an email to [security@florimus.com](mailto:anoopsunitha007@gmail.com)** with the following details:
    - A description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the issue.
    - Any other relevant information (e.g., your environment, logs, screenshots).

3. **Expect an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours.** We will review the report and work on a fix. We will keep you informed about the progress and may reach out for additional information or clarification.

4. **We will aim to release a fix as soon as possible.** Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will publish a new release and disclose the issue responsibly.

## Security Update Policy

We are committed to timely fixing of security vulnerabilities. Security updates will be prioritized and released as quickly as possible.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure!
